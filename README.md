## Features

- **Multi-Currency Support:** Stream Payment Gateway supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, SPL tokens, and stablecoins, allowing users to transact in their preferred digital assets.

- **Transparent Fee Structure:** The gateway employs a clear fee structure, including a 1.5% merchant fee, calculated and deducted from payments to provide transparency for users.

- **Payment Stream Creation:** Users can initiate payment streams, specifying payer and recipient wallet addresses and the initial payment amount. Streams can be set up for one-time or recurring transactions.

- **Payment Processing:** Payments within a stream are processed securely, with fees calculated and deducted automatically before transferring the net payment amount to the recipient.

- **Stream Closure and Refunds:** Users can close payment streams when they are no longer needed. The gateway calculates and deducts applicable fees and refunds the remaining amount to the payer.

- **Robust Security Measures:** Robust security measures, including key management, encryption, and regulatory compliance, are in place to safeguard user data and assets.

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms protect user accounts and transactions from unauthorized access.

- **Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:** Real-time monitoring and alerting ensure system health and security event visibility.

- **Scalability and Load Balancing:** The system is designed to scale horizontally, seamlessly handling increased transaction volumes with load balancers and auto-scaling mechanisms.

## Additional Features

### Token Swap and Conversion Support

Stream Payment Gateway now includes a token swap and conversion feature, allowing users to seamlessly exchange one digital asset for another within the platform. This feature provides users with increased flexibility and convenience when managing their assets.

Key Highlights:

- Integrated with popular decentralized exchanges (DEXs) for efficient token swaps.
- User-friendly interface with real-time conversion rates and fee estimates.
- Efficient transaction handling with liquidity management.

### Governance Mechanism

We've introduced a decentralized governance mechanism that empowers token holders and stakeholders to actively participate in decision-making and protocol upgrades. This adds a layer of decentralization and community involvement to the Stream Payment Gateway ecosystem.

Key Highlights:

- Token-based voting system for proposals and decisions.
- Framework for submitting, discussing, and voting on governance proposals.
- User-friendly voting interface within the frontend.
- Transparent decision implementation and community engagement.

### Cross-Chain Compatibility

Stream Payment Gateway now offers cross-chain compatibility, allowing users to initiate payments between the Solana blockchain and other blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. This feature enables a broader range of use cases and expands the reach of the gateway.

Key Highlights:

- Integration with cross-chain bridge providers to facilitate cross-chain transactions.
- Support for wrapped tokens to represent assets from other blockchains on Solana.
- User education and documentation on cross-chain functionality.

### Integration with Solana Ecosystem

We have enhanced the gateway's integration with the Solana ecosystem by supporting Solana's native token standards and leveraging the Solana Token Registry for asset discovery. Users can seamlessly interact with other Solana-based projects and wallets within the gateway.

Key Highlights:

- Integration with Solana's SPL token standards for compatibility.
- Utilization of the Solana Token Registry to discover and transact with supported assets.
- Collaboration with Solana-based DeFi platforms to offer additional financial services.
